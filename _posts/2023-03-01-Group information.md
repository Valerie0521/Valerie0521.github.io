Our initial target is to develop a smart-watch style health monitoring device, which can help the elderly to keep track of their health condition, avoid areas with exposure risk of virus, and provides emergency function like calling the ambulance.

Our device should consider the need of the elderly.

1. They are not familiar with smart devices, so the operation should be simple.
2. Icons should be made large and eye-catching
3. The application's alert function should be passive rather than active, as older people are likely to forget to check this device frequently

The further design and details will be implemented through discussion later.
