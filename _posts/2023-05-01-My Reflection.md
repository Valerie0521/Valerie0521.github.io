I learned a lot through this lesson.

Previously I focused more on the actual implementation of a certain application, but rarely think of the design and motivation of an application, and also rarely think about user's need and how to better serve the users.

I learned how to deal with user's need. The need should be found and decided before actually design an application. I also learned how to systemically find and define user's need through models.

Besides, I also learned more about how to think from user's side, so that I can better design a application that can satisfy user's need. I also learned the process of drawing prototype and defining work flow and interaction procedure of an application.

The evaluation of an application is also learned through this lesson. I learned how to design a good questionnaire and how to evaluate an application.

Overall, this is a really benefiting lesson for broaden my horizon, and it provides me a good opportunity to learn and think about the application of mine from a different view point.
