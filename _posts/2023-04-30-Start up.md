Currently, we have finished the Phase-1 presentation of our group work.

The additional work for Phase-2 is to build a prototype and shoot a video of our Guardian-on-Wrist, which is a smart watch.

TODO list:

1. draw a prototype
2. write scripts for the presentation-video 
3. shoot the video
4. polish the ppt
5. The evaluation should be designed and conducted

The date for video shooting is confirmed.

These days we will do some furthur research and detail design for the Guardian-on-Wrist.
Next meeting will be held tomorrow, and we will make a detailed plan for doing the Phase-2 presentation.
