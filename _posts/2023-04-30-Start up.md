Currently, we've finished the Phase-1 presentation of our group work.

The additional work for Phase-2 is to build a prototype and shoot a video of our Guardian-on-Wrist, which is a smart watch.

TODO list:

1. draw a prototype
2. write scripts for the presentation-video 
3. shoot the video
4. polish the ppt
